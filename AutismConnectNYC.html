	<h3><strong>What is Autism?</strong></h3>
		<p align="left"><iframe align="right" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d4G0HTIUBlI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>According to the Autism Center of Excellence <br>in the School of Medecine of UC San Diego,<br>
		 autism is a developmental disorder that starts <br>affecting someone prior to an agee of three years.<br> During this time the brain develops and functions abnormally. Some symptoms of autism are <br>decreased social skills and repetitive<br> patterns of behaviors and interests.<br>Here is a helpful video that goes into more detail about autism to better understand autism.<br></p>


	<h4><strong>Our Mission</strong></h4>
		<p>Our purpose at AutismConnect NYC is to connect parents of autistic children residing in any of the five boroughs of NYC to locations that provide school and after school programs for autistic children. Through this, parents will be able to go to work without worrying if their child is in good hands.</p>
		<p>All you have to do is either complete our survey asking about information regarding your location and preferences for the program you would like your child in. If you don't have time to complete the survey then you can just click on "Map" on the top of our page to access our map with all our locations.</p>
	<!-- <h5><strong>Who We Are</strong></h5>
		<p> Hello and thank you for visiting our website! Our names are Frannie, Amanda, Liset and Yisel and we are the creators of this website. We are a part of Adobe NYC Summer Immersion Program of Girls Who Code and this website is our final project. We made this website with the purpose of connecting parents who don't really have experience with autistic children to schools and after school programs. These programs have the general purpose of making sure autistic children have the same educational experience as a child without autism. Our website focuses on one of the most populated areas of the United States-New York City! With a population of almost 9 million we hope to help out any parents out of that 9 million who have autistic children that they need help with taking care of.</p>
