<h5><strong>Who We Are</strong></h5>
		<p> Hello and thank you for visiting our website! Our names are Frannie, Amanda, Liset and Yisel and we are the creators of this website. We are a part of Adobe NYC Summer Immersion Program of Girls Who Code and this website is our final project. We made this website with the purpose of connecting parents who don't really have experience with autistic children to schools and after school programs. These programs have the general purpose of making sure autistic children have the same educational experience as a child without autism. Our website focuses on one of the most populated areas of the United States-New York City! With a population of almost 9 million we hope to help out any parents out of that 9 million who have autistic children that they need help with taking care of.</p>
