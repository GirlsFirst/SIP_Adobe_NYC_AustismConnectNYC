		 autism is a developmental disorder that starts <br>affecting someone prior to the age of three years.<br> During this time the brain develops and functions abnormally. Some symptoms of autism are <br>decreased social skills and repetitive<br> patterns of behaviors and interests.<br>Here is a helpful video that goes into more detail about autism to better understand the disorder.<br></p>


	<h4><strong>Our Mission</strong></h4>
		<p>Our purpose at AutismConnect NYC is to connect parents of autistic children residing in any of the five boroughs of NYC to locations that provide school and after school programs for autistic children. Through this website, parents will be able to go to work without worrying if their child is in good hands.</p>
		<p>All you have to do is either complete our survey asking about information regarding your location and preferences for the program you would like your child in. If you don't have time to complete the survey then you can just click on "Map" on the top of our page to access our map with all the locations.</p>
