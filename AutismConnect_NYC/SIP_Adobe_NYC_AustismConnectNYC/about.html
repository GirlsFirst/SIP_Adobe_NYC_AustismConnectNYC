	<h5><strong>Who We Are</strong></h5>
		<p> Hello! Thank you for visiting our website! Our names are Frannie, Amanda, Liset and Yisel and we are the creators of this website. We are a part of the Adobe NYC Summer Immersion Program of Girls Who Code and this website is our final project. We made this website with the purpose of connecting parents who don't have experience with autistic children to schools and after school programs that cater to autistic children. These programs have the general purpose of making sure autistic children have the same educational experience as a child without autism. Our website focuses on one of the most populated areas of the United States-New York City! With a population of almost 9 million we hope to assist any parents from that 9 million with autistic children. We hope that you enjoy our website.</p><br>

		<p><strong>Frannie</strong><br>
			Hi! My name is Frannie and I volunteer at FirefliesNY,<br>
			a physical and occupational therapy studio in Brooklyn that<br>
			teaches the major tenets of Taekwondo to children ages 3.5-15 who<br>
			are on the autism/aspergers spectrum. As a volunteer there, I learned<br>
			what a struggle it can be for parents of children with special needs to<br>
			decide on the right education and afterschool or extracurricular options.<br>
			In the creation of this project, I hoped to simplify this process and make<br>
			the multitude of resources in New York City easier to navigate. <br>

		<p><strong>Amanda</strong><br>
			Hello I am Amanda. I chose this project because I<br>
			think that it will be really helpful to a lot of families<br>
			with autistic children. Especially after trying to find all of<br>
			the programs for children and realizing how scarce they are<br>
			in some locations. I also really enjoy using the google maps<br>
			API and worked a lot finding the locations as well as programming<br>
			the map.<br>
			Email: amanda1stuart@gmail.com</p>
		<p><strong>Liset</strong><br>
			Hey! I am Liset and I chose this project because<br>
			I felt that this was an important cause that I was into.<br>
			This was a great way to help parents of autistic children <br>
			find schools and afterschool programs for their children in a <br>
			convenient way. I was involved in backend programming and organizing<br>
			the information of the schools and programs we found.<br>
			Email: lisetguaman99@gmail.com</p>
		<p><strong>Yisel</strong><br>
			Hello! My name's Yisel and I'm 17  years old. I chose<br>
			to work on this team because I really liked what the project idea<br>
			was about since I have two autistic cousins and can relate to how<br>
			difficult it can be to search for appropriate programs to<br>
			send a child to. I worked mostly on the design and layout of the website.<br>
			Here's my email incase you would like to get in contact with me.<br>
